# ⚡eWand: a smart portable electrostatic charge generator

**This project is still highly WIP, as of right now, it does generate charge, but not much control is possible yet.**
<br>
This project is a group project, deriving from my school's project-based learning month.
<br>
Documentation is WIP.

## ⚙️Main features
- Portable
- Fully solid-state operation
- Precisely controllable output
- Output charge measurement (WIP)
- Wireless connectivity
  - Remote configuration & control
  - Data feedback

## Usages
- Physics teaching aid
- ESD testing
- ...

## Notes
- This project is inspired by [Join The Technicians's device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUDd5lzepgE), but adds more "smart" features to make it more useful as a teaching aid device and for other purposes.
